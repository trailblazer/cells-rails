    # In Rails, there are about 10 different implementations of #url_for. Rails doesn't like the idea of objects, so they
    # have helpers in modules. Those module are now included sequentially into other modules and/or classes. While they
    # get included, they might or might not include methods, depending on the including module/class
    # (example here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/cad20f720c4c6e04584253cd0a23f22b3d43ab0f/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/url_for.rb#L87).
    #
    # The outcome is that several module override #url_for, and if you're lucky, this works. If you're not, then #url_for breaks
    # due to a raise in one of its basic implementations, introduced in 3.x, fixed in 4.0 and then re-introduced in 4.2
    #
    # This is extremely frustrating as no one in Rails core seems to tackle this problem and introduces a url object instead
    # of this module madness. I have to constantly test and fix it in Cells. With the module below, I'll stop doing this.
    #
    # Either Rails works with Cells and we fix this in form of a URL object that gets passed into the cell (I'm happy with
    # a global object here, too! Wow!) or URL helpers will stop working in Cells and a lot of people will be unhappy.
    #
    # Anyway, this is the reason we need this patch module. If you have trouble with URLs in Cells, then please ask Rails to
    # fix their implementation. Thank you.
